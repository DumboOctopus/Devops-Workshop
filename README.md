# Devops Workshop

## Summary
1. Create a web application using express
2. Host it on AWS

## Details
1. Each class on Friday and was 4 hours long
2. Students are expected to have intermediate programming experience (with any language)

## About this repo
1. Look at the readme in each folder for that day's summary.
2. In all of the express projects, I excluded the `node_modules` so you will need to run `npm install` before running the code.


## Questions?
1. This course was specifically for cod.ed staff so if y'all have questions
just slack me.
