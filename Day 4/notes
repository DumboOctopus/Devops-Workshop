NOTE: we did not follow these notes exactly. See readme instead.

Review everything!!
Especially terminal and current working directory
operating system :DDD
explain what an OS is
  explain what an ip address is
  explain what a port is
  explain what a virtual machine is

explain mongo roles more:
* read
* readWrite
* dbAdmin
  change what kinda of data the models hold (changing the schemas)

* userAdmin
  add users and roles
* root
  readWriteAnyDatabase, dbAdminAnyDatabase, userAdminAnyDatabase, clusterAdmin, restore, backup
So on the day 3 tutorial, I actually used userAdminAnyDatabase but we should have used root because lets say the Notes model schema changes. Then we need a user who can perform dbAdmin.


now lets set up mongo db with a thing called Docker :D

first, we need to kill our local mongo since our dockerized mongo will use the same port
mongo
db.shutdownServer()

mongo -u user -p user123 --authenticationDatabase notes_db

install docker-compose

docker-compose -d on server after copying files
